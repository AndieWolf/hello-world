# hello-world
My initial repository

I'm new to writing code for the various electronic devices that myself and others such as my best friend use. I hope that I can learn more about code-writing here on GitHub.

I have a major love for plants and their many and varied uses for both humans and animals. I am very happy to share this knowledge with you.  😍
